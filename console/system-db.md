# System DB

![](../.gitbook/assets/system-settings%20%281%29.png)

This page displays the current System Database in a JSON editor. These settings are used to populate the interface for [Publish Configuration](publish-changes.md).

The settings are:

* **buckets**: the complete list of buckets to which a Configuration can be pushed.
* **branch\_buckets:** the _default_ list of buckets for each branch. When a Configuration is published, the default buckets for the branch will be initially selected in the Publish Configuration interface \(but they can be changed before publishing\).
